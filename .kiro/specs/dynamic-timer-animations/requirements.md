# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements dynamic height animations for chess timer squares in mobile view to enhance user experience through smooth visual transitions. The timer squares will dynamically adjust their heights based on the active player state, with the active player's square expanding to 70% height while the inactive player's square contracts to 20% height. Game controls will smoothly animate to maintain their centered position between the squares.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile chess player, I want the active timer square to visually expand when it's my turn, so that I can easily identify which player's time is currently running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN both timer squares SHALL display at 40% height of the available screen space
2. WHEN a player becomes active THEN their timer square SHALL animate to 70% height within 0.8-1.0 seconds
3. WHEN a player becomes inactive THEN their timer square SHALL animate to 20% height within 0.8-1.0 seconds
4. WHEN rapid player switches occur THEN the animations SHALL handle state changes without lag or stutter

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile chess player, I want the game controls to stay properly positioned between timer squares during animations, so that the interface remains intuitive and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timer squares change height THEN the mobile controls SHALL animate to the center point between the two squares
2. WHEN the top player is active THEN controls SHALL position below the expanded top square and above the contracted bottom square
3. WHEN the bottom player is active THEN controls SHALL position above the expanded bottom square and below the contracted top square
4. WHEN animations occur THEN all elements SHALL animate simultaneously with matching timing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile chess player, I want smooth, premium-quality animations that maintain 60fps performance, so that the interface feels responsive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN height animations execute THEN they SHALL use premium easing curves for natural motion
2. WHEN animations run THEN they SHALL maintain 60fps performance throughout
3. WHEN using Framer Motion THEN transform-based animations SHALL be preferred for optimal performance
4. WHEN rapid state changes occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without performance degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile chess player, I want all existing visual styling to remain unchanged during height animations, so that the familiar interface design is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN height animations occur THEN width, colors, fonts, and existing UI styling SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN squares resize THEN only the height property SHALL be modified
3. WHEN animations execute THEN all typography, gradients, and visual effects SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN layout changes occur THEN existing responsive design patterns SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile chess player, I want the height calculations to use precise percentages of screen space, so that the layout is consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating heights THEN all percentages SHALL be relative to 90% of screen height with 10% reserved for margins
2. WHEN in default state THEN layout SHALL be Top(40%) + Controls(center) + Bottom(40%) + Margins(20%)
3. WHEN top player is active THEN layout SHALL be Top(70%) + Controls(below) + Bottom(20%) + Margins(10%)
4. WHEN bottom player is active THEN layout SHALL be Top(20%) + Controls(above) + Bottom(70%) + Margins(10%)
